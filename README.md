# Crossword Solver

This Crossword Solver is implemented with Backtracking algorithm, and allows us to find the solution of a specific crossword board. Because of the simplicity of this algorithm, we only can solve little boards. With large boards, complexity and elapsed time can grow exponential.

Also, our Backtracking algorithm has got Fordward-Checking techniques, which speeds up our code by skipping word combinations that will lead to fail.
